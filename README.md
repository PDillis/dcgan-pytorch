# DCGAN in `PyTorch`

A reimplementation of DCGAN in `PyTorch`. Although there is an
abundant source of code and examples found online (as well
as an official [`PyTorch` tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html),
the codebase does not really fit my style, as well they lack
the flexibility for adding intermediate layers/blocks, generating
interpolation loops, visualizing intermediate representations, you name it.
